Minutes:

	• Agree on a preliminary task assignment plan:
		○ Not one expert on one specific task. That makes us less fault tolerant.
		○ Each member should have one page or set of pages of the app to work on. It is not necessary to become a full-stack, but each member should have a good understanding of the technologies we are using. This approach is:
			§ Community driven.
			§ Fault tolerant.
			§ Equips us with very demanded knowledge in the industry; ergo, this will be useful at a professional level for everyone on the team.

	• Work on revised proposal:
		○ Will move testing plans for each user story to a new section.
		○ Create Labels.
		○ Tweak requirements.
		○ Tweak wording, syntax, grammar, etc.

	• Mockup draft:
  
		Panes:
