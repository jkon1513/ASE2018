# Notes on Meeting 2 - Oct. 09 2018

## Agenda:

* Discuss task delegation
* Work on revised proposal.
* Android Studio
* Design Mockup

## Task Delegation
 
We agreed to split up responsibilities by feature rather than technology. Doing so will prevent any one person from being the "expert" on a given tech. This makes our development cycle more fault tolerant since we will all be familiar with all the technology, and also enables us to support one another. 

## Revised proposal
* adding a testing plan section
* rewiriting test plans to conform to design mockup

## Mockup

The photo of the mockup design we created for Lion GPS can be found in the `docs` directory of the repository and is included below for convenience. It should be reviewed intently to gain a sense of design and positioning. The main idea was that we defined 3 major 'pages' of our app.

* `Map`: Contains the main overlay displaying the map. It will have a searchbar in the top, a pane on the left side that when pulled out displays recent history and a link the users profile page. 
* `Profile`: Where the user's profile will be displayed. This includes destination history, student schedule and if possible, SSOL integration. 
* `Login`: a simple welcome page allowing users to login. This is where authentication occurs
