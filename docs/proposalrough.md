## Summary
Lion GPS will be an android application that provides directions for students to their given class' building. It will store previous destinations and a list of locations on campus supplied by the student to a user profile, and retrieve and mutate that information as the app is used. The directions will be generated by our usage of the Google Maps API, along with additional pathing logic supplied by our team to account for deficiencies/knowledge gaps in Google's pathing logic.  

## Motivation
Often times when starting a new semester because of the sprawling nature of Columbia's campus it is common to have class in a building you are unfamilair with. The aim of LionGPS is to eliminate the hassle of finding new buildings by providing easy to follow walking instructions from any point on campus, to any building one wants to find. 

## User Stories
 * A user wants to be able to be given reliable directions, so that they can find the quickest route to any stucture on campus.
 
 * A user wants to be able to quickly and easily see a history of where they have been so they can easilly retreive those directions again.
 
 * A user wants to see an overlay of where their classes reside atop a map of the Columbia campus, so they can have a handy visual reference of where all their classes and seminars reside. 
 
 * A user wants to be able to use in the colloquial name of a Columbia building - or the SSOL building code - when finding directions, to avoid having to use the full address of a location on campus. 
 
 * A user wants to start typing a location, and the application shows recommendations as they type, so they can save time.

 * As a new student, I want an easy way to keep track of my classes. My
   conditions of satisfaction are that I can create a table of my classes and
   the buildings they are in. 

 * As a new student, I want to tap on a building on the map to learn more
   about it. My conditions of satisfaction are that a link will redirect me to
   wikicu.com.

## Stretch Goal

* Plug into SSOL to automate the process of transfer course data to our app.
 
* Authentification through Facebook for faster login.

* As a new student, I want to find new friends who are taking the same classes.
  My conditions of satisfaction are that there is a "share to Facebook" button
  which will let other budding young Lions find me.
