# Lion GPS

## Part 0

We will use the java programming language on the MacOS operating to develop our program. 

## Summary
Lion GPS will be an android application that provides directions for students to their given class' building. It will save previous destinations to a users profile. We will retrieve these directions using the google maps api, then relay them to the user. 

## Motivation
Often times when starting a new semester because of the sprawling nature of Columbia's campus it is common to have class in a building you are unfamilair with. The aim of LionGPS is to eliminate the hassle of finding new buildings by providing easy to follow walking instructions from any point on campus, to any building one wants to find. 

## User Stories
 * A user wants to be able to be given reliable directions, so that they can find their clases, seminars and other events without hassle. 
 
 * A user wants to be able to quickly and easily see a history of where they have been so they can easilly retreive those directions again.
 
 * A user wants to see an overlay of where their classes reside atop a map of the Columbia campus, so they can have a handy visual reference of where all their classes and seminars reside.
 
 * A user wants to be able to type in their location of their courses and have the program recognize and remember that location, so they don't have to type full addresses every time they need directions
