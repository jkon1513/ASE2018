# Lion GPS

## Part 0

We will use the Java programming language on the MacOS operating system to develop our program. Android Studio will be our IDE/Development tool of choice. We will use NoSQL via MongoDB for our database and persistent storage needs.

## Summary
Lion GPS will be an android application that provides directions for students to their given class' building. It will store previous destinations and a list of locations on campus supplied by the student to a user profile, and retrieve and mutate that information as the app is used. The directions will be generated by our usage of the Google Maps API. The app will also store a user's class schedule.

## Motivation
Often times when starting a new semester because of the sprawling nature of Columbia's campus it is common to have class in a building you are unfamiliar with. The aim of LionGPS is to eliminate the hassle of finding new buildings by providing easy to follow walking instructions from any point on campus, to any building one wants to find. 

## User Stories
* `Routing:`As a student, I want to know where all my class buildings are. My
  conditions of satisfaction are that LionGPS will give me a route from my
  current location to the building of my choice.

* `Recent Search:` As a student, I want to see a "recent search" section so I will not have to
  search for the same building multiple times. My conditions of satisfaction
  are that there is a section of the app showing my 10 most recent searches.

* `Overlay:` As a student, I want to see an overlay of where their classes reside atop a map of the Columbia campus, so I can have a handy visual reference of where all my classes and seminars reside. 
  
 
* `Building Nicknames:`As a student, I want to be able to use  the colloquial name of a Columbia building - or the SSOL building code - when finding directions, to avoid having to type the full address of a location on campus. 
 
* `Auto-completion:` As a student, I want to start typing a location, and have the application show recommendations as I type, so I can save time.

* ` Class Schedule` As a student, I want an easy way to keep track of my classes. My
   conditions of satisfaction are that I can create a table of my classes and
   the buildings they are in, and will be able to retrieve this list after
   closing and re-opening the app 

   
## Testing Plan

* `Routing:` A user is routed to the building of thier choice when selecting a destination from either the search function, thier recent history or their student schedule. The expected input is a building choice represented internally as a String / GPS coordinate. Expected results are a path that spans from the users starting point to the building they choose. This can be tested by comparing the final destination of the path provided with the GPS coordinate of the inputted building. Further testing will be accomplished with manual testing (from and to) many different locations on Columbia.  

* `Recent Search:` To see the recent search section, the user will open a pane from the side of the map overlay that displays there recent destinations. The expected input would be a user profile for which the history must be loaded, and the expected output is the list of previously searched destinations. This can be tested by generating user profiles and having a random list of buildings those profiles will request directions to. We then will compare the list of searched destinations with the populated history for each given profile. 

* `Overlay:` To see an overlay of a students classes, they will open the app and see a "Class Map" link on the home screen of the app. They will then tap the "Class Map" link which should load a map with pins dropped on all the users buildings. Expected results for success are that a map with the correct buildings pinned appears on the screen. Expected results for failure are when a user taps the "Class Map" link and nothing happens, a map loads of the Columbia campus, but no pins are dropped, or a class map loads and the pins are in the wrong location, or if the app crashes.

* `Building Nicknames:` The user should be able to input a colloquial name of a building on campus e.g. `Hamilton` or a building code like `HAM` into our scheduler, and have the app recognize the location associated with that name. Expected results for failure are if a user inputs a building code and the app returns an error screen indicating that the code or nick name is not a valid Columbia Location.

* `Auto-completion:` Expected conditions for failure are if a user inputs the name of a building and not suggestions pop up, or if the wrong recommendations appear.

## Stretch Stories

* As a student, I want to be able to plug into SSOL to automate the process of transfering my class locations into the app.
 
* As a student, I want to log into my apps with as
  little friction as possible. My conditions of satisfaction are that I can log
  into LionGPS using authentificaiton with facebook.

* As a student, I want to find new friends who are taking the same classes.
  My conditions of satisfaction are that there is a "share to Facebook" button
  which will let other budding young Lions find me. 

* As a student, I want to tap on a building on the map to learn more
  about it. My conditions of satisfaction are that a link will redirect me to
  wikicu.com.

* As a student, I want to know where all the libraries are. My
   conditions of satisfaction are that I can tap a "Libraries" button on the home screen and a map will appear
   on the screen with pins dropped on each building with a library. 

* As a student, I want to know where all the coffee shops on
   campus are. My conditions of satisfaction are that I can tap a "Coffee
   Shops" button and a map will appear on the screen with pins dropped on each building with a coffee shop.
