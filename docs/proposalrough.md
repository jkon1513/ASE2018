# Lion GPS

## Summary
Lion GPS will be an android application that provides directions for students to their given class' building. It will save previous destinations to a users profile. We will retrieve these directions using the google maps api, then relay them to the user. 

## Motivation
Often times when starting a new semester because of the sprawling nature of Columbia's campus it is common to have class in a building you are unfamilair with. The aim of LionGPS is to eliminate the hassle of finding new buildings by providing easy to follow walking instructions from any point on campus, to any building one wants to find.
