## Summary
Lion GPS will be an android application that provides directions for students to their given class' building. It will store previous destinations and a list of locations on campus supplied by the student to a user profile, and retrieve and mutate that information as the app is used. The directions will be generated by our usage of the Google Maps API, along with additional pathing logic supplied by our team to account for deficiencies/knowledge gaps in Google's pathing logic. The app will also store a user's class schedule.

## Motivation
Often times when starting a new semester because of the sprawling nature of Columbia's campus it is common to have class in a building you are unfamiliar with. The aim of LionGPS is to eliminate the hassle of finding new buildings by providing easy to follow walking instructions from any point on campus, to any building one wants to find. 

## User Stories
* As a student, I want to know where all my class buildings are. My
  conditions of satisfaction are that LionGPS will give me a route from my
  current location to the building of my choice.

  Testing plan: To navigate to a class building, a user will need to select the building. This can be accomplished by typing into a search bar, or tapping a link for the building from recent searches, or tapping a link from the users list of classes. Expected results for success are when a user taps the link a pin is dropped on Google Maps so the user can see its location and ask for directions from current location. Expected results for failure will be when the user clicks the building link, but the maps page does not open, or it opens and a pin is dropped in the wrong location, there is no option to get directions, or if the app crashes.


* As a student, I want to see a "recent search" section so I will not have to
  search for the same building multiple times. My conditions of satisfaction
  are that there is a section of the app showing my 10 most recent searches.

  Testing plan: To see the recent search section, the user should just open the app. Expected results for success are that the student sees recent searches upon opening the app. Expected results for failure are if a user does not see recent searches, the searches are for the wrong buildings, or if the app crashes.
    

* As a student, I want to see an overlay of where their classes reside atop a map of the Columbia campus, so I can have a handy visual reference of where all my classes and seminars reside. 
  
  Testing plan: To see an overlay of a students classes, they will open the app and see a "Class Map" link on the home screen of the app. They will then tap the "Class Map" link which should load a map with pins dropped on all the users buildings. Expected results for success are that a map with the correct buildings pinned appears on the screen. Expected results for failure are when a user taps the "Class Map" link and nothing happens, a map loads of the Columbia campus, but no pins are dropped, or a class map loads and the pins are in the wrong location, or if the app crashes.

  
 
* As a student, I want to be able to use  the colloquial name of a Columbia building - or the SSOL building code - when finding directions, to avoid having to type the full address of a location on campus. 
 
* As a student, I want to start typing a location, and have the application show recommendations as I type, so I can save time.

* As a student, I want an easy way to keep track of my classes. My
   conditions of satisfaction are that I can create a table of my classes and
   the buildings they are in, and will be able to retrieve this list after
   closing and re-opening the app 


## Stretch Stories

* As a student, I want to be able to plug into SSOL to automate the process of transfering my class locations into the app.
 
* As a student, I want to log into my apps with as
  little friction as possible. My conditions of satisfaction are that I can log
  into LionGPS using authentificaiton with facebook.

* As a student, I want to find new friends who are taking the same classes.
  My conditions of satisfaction are that there is a "share to Facebook" button
  which will let other budding young Lions find me. 

* As a student, I want to tap on a building on the map to learn more
  about it. My conditions of satisfaction are that a link will redirect me to
  wikicu.com.

* As a student, I want to know where all the libraries are. My
   conditions of satisfaction are that I can tap a "Libraries" button on the home screen and a map will appear
   on the screen with pins dropped on each building with a library. 

* As a student, I want to know where all the coffee shops on
   campus are. My conditions of satisfaction are that I can tap a "Coffee
   Shops" button and a map will appear on the screen with pins dropped on each building with a coffee shop.
