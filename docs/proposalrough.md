## Summary
Lion GPS will be an android application that provides directions for students to their given class' building. It will store previous destinations and a list of locations on campus supplied by the student to a user profile, and retrieve and mutate that information as the app is used. The directions will be generated by our usage of the Google Maps API, along with additional pathing logic supplied by our team to account for deficiencies/knowledge gaps in Google's pathing logic.  

## Motivation
Often times when starting a new semester because of the sprawling nature of Columbia's campus it is common to have class in a building you are unfamilair with. The aim of LionGPS is to eliminate the hassle of finding new buildings by providing easy to follow walking instructions from any point on campus, to any building one wants to find. 

## User Stories
 * A user wants to be able to be given reliable directions, so that they can find the quickest route to any stucture on campus.
 
 * A user wants to be able to quickly and easily see a history of where they have been so they can easilly retreive those directions again.
 
 * A user wants to see an overlay of where their classes reside atop a map of the Columbia campus, so they can have a handy visual reference of where all their classes and seminars reside. 
 
 * A user wants to be able to use in the colloquial name of a Columbia building - or the SSOL building code - when finding directions, to avoid having to use the full address of a location on campus. 
 
 * A user wants to start typing a location, and the application shows recommendations as they type, so they can save time.
   
## Stretch Goal

* Plug into SSOL to automate the process of transfer course data to our app.
