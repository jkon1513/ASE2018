80 claremont:
    
80 Claremont is a 5-story building on the southwest corner of Union Theological Seminary's quadrangle on 120th Street between Broadway and Claremont Avenue. The building was constructed in the Gothic style. Columbia took possession of the building through a 99 year lease in 2005 following $4 million in renovations as part of a short-term expansion plan that also includes the lease of Knox Hall.
80 Claremont is home to the Religion Department and Science and Technology Ventures. Religion gained 70 percent more space than it had in Kent Hall, while EALAC and MEALAC expanded into the vacated space in Kent.

alfred lerner hall:

Alfred Lerner Hall is the student center. It was built from 1996-1999, replacing Ferris Booth Hall, and is named for donor Alfred Lerner CC'55.
Lerner is notorious for its infuriating system of space-wasting and inefficient upward-spiralling ramps. The stairs in the 'exit' stairwells are actually the quickest way to navigate Lerner.
